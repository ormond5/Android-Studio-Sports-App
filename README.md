# Android Studio Sports App
Hello World! 
The zip file above is a copy of my Sports Inventory app
that I created as part of the requirement for my Social and Mobile Application Programming class. 
This course was done during my Masters in Computer and Network Security at the University of Essex, UK.  
Most of the programming is done in the LogInActivity and MainActivity! Here are a few snapshots of the app.
